Here We consider three to four methods: classical Fisher’s t-test, Fisher – Behrens 
test based on fiducial approach, Welch (WS) test by Welch (1938 and 1947) and 
Banerjee’s approach by Saibal Banerjee by computing the type 1 error probability and 
power of those tests by monte carlo simulation under different choices of sample size and means and variances  and conclude which is better.
